NodeJS/SocketIO --> TS3(MusicBot)Client

Websockets/WebRTC

1. Get Microphone input from Browser (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MediaDevices/getUserMedia) 
2. Send audio over websockets/webrtc to Server (in our case TS3Client would act as the Websocket Server)
3. TS3Client will process audio and send it to TS3Server
